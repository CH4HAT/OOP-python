# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Problems
## Description
This repository contains a series of beginner-level Python problems designed to demonstrate the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each problem illustrates fundamental OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and method functionalities. The problems are implemented in Python and are aimed at helping learners understand the practical applications of OOP.

## Problems Covered
### Library Management System:
A system for managing books in a library. Features include adding books, borrowing, and returning books.

### Rental Car System:
A basic rental car management system. Allows for adding cars, displaying available cars, and renting cars by make and model.

### Student Management System:
A system for managing student information, including adding and removing students and displaying all students.

### Course Management System:
Manages course information and enrolled students, including functionalities for adding and removing students from courses.

### Employee Management System:
A system to manage employee records, including adding and removing employees, and calculating total salary expenses.

### Bank Account Management:
A simulation of a banking system with different types of accounts (savings and checking). Includes functionalities for deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.

## Usage
Each class demonstrates the following OOP concepts:

### Encapsulation: 
Attributes are encapsulated within classes, allowing controlled access through methods.
### Inheritance: 
Derived classes demonstrate how to inherit properties and methods from parent classes.
### Polymorphism: 
Methods can be overridden in derived classes to implement specific functionalities.
